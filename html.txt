Title: How buying works on eBay
Content: ## There are two ways to buy on eBay. With Buy It Now, you pay a fixed
price and buy the item immediately, or you can bid on an item and try to win
it for a lower price in an auction. On some listings you can also make an
offer of the price you'd like to pay.

How eBay worksOn eBay, sellers create listings for
their items which include the item description, photos, and payment and
shipping options.Some listings are auctions where the highest bidder wins the
item, while many sellers offer a Buy it now option so you can buy and pay for
the item immediately.TipWhether you've bought an item straight away or you're
bidding on a listing, you can keep track of all your buying activity in your

Title: Making a Best Offer
Content: ## Best Offer lets you offer the seller a price you're willing to pay for
the item. The seller can accept, reject, or counter your offer by suggesting
another price.

 ## You can use Best Offer when you see the Make
Offer button on a listing. The seller can accept, reject, or counter your
offer.

 ## Are you a seller looking to add a Best Offer option to
your listings? Read our article on  [adding Best Offer to listings](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-buy-now/adding-best-
offer-listing?id=4144)Best Offer is a great
way to buy the item you've been looking for at a bargain price. As well as
saving money, you won't have to wait for the listing to end to buy your item,
if the seller accepts your offer.How to make a Best
OfferYou can make a Best Offer on listings that have a Make Offer
button.Once you've found an item you want to buy that accepts Best Offers,
here's how to make your offer:1. Choose Make Offer.
2. Enter your
offer. If you like, you can add a message to the seller.
3. Select
Continue.
4. On the next page, you may be asked to confirm your payment
and shipping information. Select **Edit** if you need to change
anything.
5. Select Send.

If you've added the item to your
Watchlist, you can also select Make Best Offer next to the item in your
Watchlist.If you're making a Best Offer on an item that offers
personalization, you can add your personalization comments in the Message
field once you select Make Offer.TipWhen you make an offer or counteroffer,
you're committing to buy the item if your offer is accepted. If you entered
your payment method when making your offer, you'll be charged if the seller
accepts.How to find listings with Best OfferNot all
listings have the option to make an offer, but you can filter your search
results to find sellers who do accept offers.When you're searching for the
item you'd like to buy, you can select Accepts offers at the top of the search
results to see listings with Best Offer.You can also use Advanced search to
find Best Offer listings:1. Go to [Advanced search
\- opens in new window or tab](https://www.ebay.com/sch/ebayadvsearch).
2. Enter your keywords.
3. Scroll
down to Buying format and select Best offer.
4. Select
Search.

What happens after you make your
offerThe seller has until your offer expires to decide whether to accept
or reject your offer. They can also suggest another price. If they don't
respond to you in that time, or if the listing ends before they respond, then
your offer expires.If the seller responds, they may:* Accept your offer:
Just like any other sale on eBay, you're obliged to pay the amount you
offered. Immediate payment is not required when the Best Offer option is used
in a listing, unless you were asked to confirm your payment method when
placing your offer
* Reject your offer: You can still make another one
(up to 3 on most items and 5 in most vehicles categories)
* Counter your
offer: The seller may suggest another price. You can choose to accept, reject,
or continue negotiating by making another offer to the seller

TipYour
offer only applies to the item price. Shipping costs and all the other terms
specified in the seller's listing remain the same.Retracting
a Best OfferWhen you make a Best Offer or a counteroffer, you're agreeing
to buy the item at that price if the seller accepts. However, if you've made a
mistake when making an offer or a counteroffer, you can retract or cancel it
in certain circumstances.You can retract an offer if:* There are 12
hours or more left before the listing ends
* You placed your most recent
offer less than an hour ago

You won't be able to retract your offer
if:* The listing ends in less than 12 hours and it's been more than an
hour since you placed your most recent offer
* The seller has already
accepted or declined your offer, or sent you a counteroffer
* You've
already made 5 offers in a specific category

If you're using the eBay
desktop site, here's how to retract a Best Offer or a counteroffer if it meets
the requirements above:1. Go to Bids/Offers in [My eBay - opens
in new window or tab](https://www.ebay.com/mye/myebay/summary).
2. Find the offer you'd like to
retract.
3. Select Review offer, then select Retract offer.

You
can also retract your offer on the item page by selecting Review offer and
then Retract offer. If you're using a mobile browser or the eBay app, go to
the [Best Offer cancellation form - opens in new window or tab](https://offer.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?RetractBestOfferShow&guest=1)
to retract your offer.Tips for making offersWhen you've
got your eye on something and have a certain price in mind, you can increase
your chances of the seller accepting your offer by having a Best Offer
strategy. Here are some tips for making offers:* Be reasonable: Sellers
who accept offers are flexible on price and generally take fair offers
seriously
* Add a message for the seller: A friendly, personal message
could help you get the item at the price you want. Look for the Add message to
seller option when you're entering your offer
* Check the item's
original listing date: If it's been listed for a long time, the seller might
be more flexible on the price
* Use your Best Offers wisely: We limit
the number of Best Offers you can make on each item, we'll let you know when
you're using your last one. Expired, rejected, and retracted offers all count
toward this limit

Responding to an offer from a
sellerIf you watch an item or add it to your cart, the seller can send
you a special offer for that item. If you receive an offer, you'll get an
email and a message in [My eBay \- opens in new window or tab](https://www.ebay.com/mye/myebay/summary). If you select
Review offer in this message, you can review and respond to the offer.If you'd
like to accept the offer, select Accept offer and proceed to checkout to
complete your purchase. If you're not interested in the offer, select Decline
offer.You can also make a counteroffer if you'd like to negotiate a better
price. Here's how:1. Select Make a counteroffer.
2. Add your amount
(this doesn't include shipping).
3. If you like, you can add a message
for the seller.
4. Select Review, then select Send.

The seller
can then accept your counteroffer, decline it, or send you a counteroffer. You
can send a maximum of 4 counteroffers to the seller. Find out more in our
article on [counteroffers](https://www.ebay.com/help/buying/buy-
now/counteroffers?id=4020).Each offer is
valid for 24 hours or until an offer is accepted, whichever comes first. With
a single item listing, the first buyer to accept the offer gets the item. With
a multiple quantity listing, buyers can continue to avail of the offer until
all items in the listing are sold or the offer expires.
